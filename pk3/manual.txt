CUSTOM CONTROLS:
RELOAD: default bound to R. If it doesn't work, then go into the console and put in "Bind R reload", where R is whatever key you want.
DROP WEAPON: default bound to R. If it doesn't work, then go into the console and put in "Bind F DropWeap", where F is whatever key you want. 




HOW THE WAD WORKS
You can only carry one heavy weapon at a time. Unarmed is buffed, each weapon is generally stronger than its unrestricted counterpart. Unarmed has a very basic combo system (primary primary primary and primary secondary have their own attack states).

You can use drop weapon while using full unarmed to perform a disarm, which will only work on zombies, but will kill them and take their weapon (except zombieman, since they have no parallel weapon for you to use; they just die).

The pistol and the uzi are sidearms, so they have no carrying restrictions. The BFG is untouched and can be carried with other stuff, since BFGfest maps would otherwise be... a mess with this mod. Still will be, but hey.

All weapons except the BFG have a strong unarmed attack as their alt-fire.

Ammo is more limited in carrying capacity, and ammo pickups correspond to their heavy weapon's clip size now.




WEAPONS:
Pistol: buffed immensely. Semi-automatic. Sidearm.

Uzi: replaces chainsaw. Full-auto, lower damage per bullet than pistol.

Shotgun: More accurate, faster fire rate. Versatile low-tier weapon.

Chaingun: Takes some time to wind up, unparalleled fire rate and DPS. Slow to carry.

Super Shotgun: Elephant gun. You want stopping power? Too bad, you can't stop something when it's in PIECES.

Rocket Launcher: Longer windup, bigger explosions, heavy munitions, slow to carry.

Plasma Rifle: High-tier versatile weapon. Good damage, good accuracy, high ammo efficiency.

BFG: Unchanged at the moment, except uses less ammo to match ammo system.
